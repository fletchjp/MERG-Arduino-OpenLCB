**OlcbBlankNode**

This is a minimal sketch that can be expanded for applications.  

It has no user CDI defined, nor memStruct, but does demonstrate that there is are minimal fields for nodeName and nodeDesc, 
which are standard practice.  

It has empty definitions for **buttons[]**, **pceCallback(unsigned int index)**, **produceFromInputs()**, **userInitAll()**, 
and **userConfigWritten()**, etc. 

Other more developed sketches may be easier to modify.
