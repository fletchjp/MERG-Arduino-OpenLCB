# MERG-Arduino-OpenLCB
 Arduino codes using OpenLCB
 
 I am going to build my own examples using the OpenLCB_Single_Thread library.
 
 I have added DUE capability to that which is as yet untested.
 
 I am going to develop my own example uses here.
 
 I have copied two of the examples to work on here.
